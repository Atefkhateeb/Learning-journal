## Text Editor:
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write
to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most
important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.
**Why You Should Use IDEs?**
You could use just about anything for a development environment — and many people use a variety of basic, individual programs in place of an IDE — but an integrated environment gives you the ability to do everything in a single editor, For example, most IDEs contain debuggers. This means you can write your code and debug it in the same program. Without an IDE, you’d have to write your code in a text editor and then debug it with an external linter or compiler. Depending on the language, this can be a frustrating mess.
