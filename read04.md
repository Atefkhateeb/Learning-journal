**HTML5** :In HTML5, web page authors donot need to close all tags, and new elements and attributes will be introduced. At the time of writing, the HTML5 specification had not been completed, but the major browser makers had started to implement many of the new features, and web page
authors were rapidly adopting the new markup.

- <!-- comment goes here --> you can use this tag when you want to add a comment to your code that will not be visible in the user's browser
- ID attribute  It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id
attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique)

- Class attribute use it when  you will want away to identify several elementsas being different from the other elements on the page.
For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want
to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links
that point to external sites. 

- I frame An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term
iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame.
